## Overview
### Description

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Utilities
- **Mobile:** Mobile App (iOS only) for now. However, this app can be expanded to Android users as well.
- **Story:** People in distress can seek immediate help by clicking the Emergency button and notify nearby users and emergency contacts (friends and family). They can also use the map feature to locate other users in the same location and come help others if needed.
- **Market:** It is designed for all people who seek help when they feel unsafe in public or even at their own home. People from minority groups may find this app helpful, especially during this tough time.

- **Scope:** This app can send notifications to people nearby who are in the vicinity of the threat and also use GPS to notify the friends and family of the user's location.
